# Authentication systems

Tuwunel gives you fine-grained control over who can register and how users
authenticate. This chapter covers everything from basic password login and
token-based invitations to full OpenID Connect federation.

- [**Legacy Authentication**](authentication/legacy.md) — Control who can register,
  token-based invitations, guest access, and basic login options.

- [**Identity Providers**](authentication/providers.md) — Single-sign-on login via GitHub, Google,
  Keycloak, and other OAuth/OIDC providers.

- [**OIDC Services**](authentication/oidc-server.md) — Tuwunel's built-in OIDC authorization
  server for next-generation Matrix applications.

- [**LDAP Delegation**](authentication/ldap.md) — Delegate user management and password authentication
  to an LDAP directory.

- [**Enterprise JWT**](authentication/jwt.md) — Operator-controlled signing key can mint a
  token that authenticates as any user.
